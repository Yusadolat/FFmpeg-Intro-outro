# Add Intro and Outro mp3 file with FFmpeg '.'

## Prerequisite

* FFmpeg You don't have it installed yet? [Grab one here](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html).
* Root Access.

### Usage

You can run each command inside process.sh  one by one or make the file executable and run once.
Make sure you're in the same directory with the files you want to work on, this script can't search for file yet
